I will be creating a sketchpad/Etch-a-Sketch for this project in javascript. This project might take some time to complete, but I am up for the
 challenge!

In this project i learned few things like:

1. Template Literals ${}: I can use template literals to grab a parameter from a function and use it inside a function to setup grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
2. ForEach: i can use a forEach method to grab divs inside of a container.
3. Event Targets: I can use event targets to target a certain element for example changing the color of the divs when hovering over them.

There are somethings that i still need review to get more of a understanding of how they work.
